          Why Endings Matter in Cinema
        </h1>

        <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-6">
          A film’s ending is often the most remembered part of its story. It’s
          the moment where emotions settle, questions are answered, and meaning
          is shaped. Long after the visuals fade, it’s the ending that stays
          with us.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          Throughout cinema history, great endings have elevated good films into
          unforgettable ones. At the same time, weak or rushed endings have left
          audiences disappointed, confused, or emotionally unsatisfied. An
          ending doesn’t just conclude a story, it defines how the entire
          journey is perceived.

          The Emotional Weight of an Ending
        </h2>

        <p className="mb-6">
          Movies invite us into their worlds, allowing us to connect deeply with
          characters, conflicts, and choices. When an ending feels earned, it
          provides emotional closure. When it doesn’t, viewers are often left
          imagining how things could have unfolded differently.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          This emotional gap is natural. Cinema is subjective, every viewer
          brings their own expectations, values, and interpretations. What feels
          satisfying to one person may feel incomplete to another.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-serif font-semibold mt-10 mb-4">
          Reimagining Stories as a Creative Expression
        </h2>

        <p className="mb-6">
          Reimagining an ending isn’t about dismissing the original work. It’s
          about engaging with it more deeply. Alternate interpretations allow
          audiences to explore different emotional outcomes, character
          decisions, and thematic conclusions.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          This kind of creative engagement turns viewers into participants.
          Instead of passively consuming stories, audiences become storytellers
          themselves, reflecting on what resonated with them and what didn’t.
        </p>

          Why Platforms Like Lumiere Exist
        </h2>

        <p className="mb-6">
          Lumiere exists to give space to these reflections. It’s a place for
          cinephiles to share thoughtful alternate endings, explore different
          perspectives, and appreciate how powerful storytelling can be when
          seen through many lenses.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-6">
          By encouraging respectful, original reinterpretations, Lumiere helps
          celebrate cinema not just as entertainment, but as an evolving
          conversation between creators and audiences.
        </p>

        <p className="text-muted-foreground mt-10">
          Cinema doesn’t end when the credits roll, sometimes, that’s when the
          conversation truly begins.
